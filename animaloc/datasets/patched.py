    ''' Class to create a virtual patched CSVDataset from a CSV file 
    
    This dataset allows you to send cropped images (i.e. patches) from 
    large original images, without saving theses patches to a local hard 
    drive.

    These patches are generated in an orderly fashion using the 
    AnnotatedImageToPatches class internally.
